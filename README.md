# cfda: Categorical Functional Data Analysis


**cfda** provides functions for the analysis of categorical functional data. 

The main contribution is the computation of an optimal encoding (real functional variable) of each state of the categorical functional data.


## Installation

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("modal-inria/cfda", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Vignette

Once the package is installed, a vignette describing the mathematical background and showing an example is available using the R command:

``` r
RShowDoc("cfda", package = "cfda")
```

## Credits

**cfda** is developed by Cristian Preda (Inria Lille, Université de Lille), Quentin Grimonprez (Inria Lille) and Vincent Vandewalle (Inria Lille, Université de Lille).
